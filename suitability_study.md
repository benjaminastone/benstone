## Suitability Study for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations

**Project description:** For this multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) study, I was tasked with finding the most suitable locations for electric vehicle charging stations based on a variety of criteria: gas station density, population density, highway density, median income, and proximity to a highway exit. The data were obtained from the U.S. Census, the 2019 5-Year American Community Survey, the Oklahoma Office of Management and Enterprise Services, the Oklahoma Department of Transportation, and the North America Highway Exits dataset by ArcGIS/Esri. 

### 1. Tools Used

In ArcGIS Pro, I used the Point Density geoprocessing tool to create a point density map of gas stations in the area. Then, I used the Line Density tool to find the density of highways. The output of both tools are raster images, with a 500x500 meter cell size. 

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
